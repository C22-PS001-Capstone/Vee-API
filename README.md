# Vee-API

## Background

We as Indonesian people usually still calculate the expense that comes from our vehicle manually, by gathering all bills that came from gas stations. We usually calculate the total expenses from all bills at the end of the month. Our problem led us to our ideas in this project. To build an integrated mobile app for tracking the expenses from our vehicle. Later on, this app will be our everydayâ€™s partner when using our vehicle.

## GCP Resources

- App Engine : to host api
- Cloud SQL : to host postgre sql
- cloud build : ci/cd
- cloud repository : ci/cd
- secret manager : save key or credential
- Monitoring : creating alert for sql and app engine cpu utilization
- API Places : search nearby gas station
- Cloud Run : deploy api for ml
- Compute Engine : deploy api for ml mode (more low latency)
